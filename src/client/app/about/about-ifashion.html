<p><a href="http://ifashion.co.za/">iFashion</a> was born from the commitment to uplift and revitalise the South African
    fashion industry. It provides the opportunity for fashion industry members to create networks that will facilitate
    action and inspire industry growth.</p>
<p>The site provides useful and up-to-date information to keep the industry on top of what is happening locally and
    abroad, to make it more competitive and encourage a thirst for quality education.</p>
<p>iFashion provides a marketing platform for all within the industry; from the student who wants to share her talent,
    to the household names we have come to know and love. By increasing local and international public awareness of
    South African clothing brands and talent, it aims to inspire increased demand and brand loyalty.</p>
