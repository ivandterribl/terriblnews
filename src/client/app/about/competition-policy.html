            All prizes won are as-is, unless otherwise stipulated by the sponsor and cannot be exchanged for cash or

            When the prize is offered in partnership with a sponsoring company, the supply of the prize is the
            responsibility of the said sponsoring company. Should the sponsor renege on the supply of the prize for
            whatever reasons, ITWeb will not be held responsible to supply the prize.
